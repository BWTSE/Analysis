This is a replication package for the Broken Windows Investigation thesis conducted by [Hampus Broman](https://github.com/HBroman) and [William Levén](https://github.com/williamleven) in 2021.

The package contains a presentation as well as the [source](https://github.com/BrokenWindowsInvestigation/Analysis) for the whole analysis performed.

Read the Broken Windows Investigation thesis for more information and justification about the analysis and procedure.

If you have any questions or feel that anything in the replication package is amiss, please [open an issue](https://github.com/BrokenWindowsInvestigation/Analysis/issues).
