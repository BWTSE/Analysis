# Broken Windows Investigation Replication Package

This is a replication package for the *Broken Windows Investigation* thesis conducted by [Hampus Broman](https://github.com/HBroman) and [William Lev√©n](https://github.com/williamleven) in 2021.

The package contains a [presentation](https://brokenwindowsinvestigation.github.io/Analysis/index.html) as well as the source for the whole analysis performed.

Read the Broken Windows Investigation thesis for more information and justification about the analysis and procedure.

## Notes

If you have any questions or feel that anything in the replication package is amiss, please [open an issue](https://github.com/BrokenWindowsInvestigation/Analysis/issues).

1. Most models have been run with moment matching to improve pareto-k diagnostics. We found no consistent errors in the loo estimates and did not include the moment matching in the replication package due its resource intensiveness.
